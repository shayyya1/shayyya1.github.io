                            I think my first real dive into computational thinking started through playing Minecraft.
                            I had just learned about logic gates in school, and in Minecraft there is redstone which functions the same way.
                            It quickly became a major project of mine to create an addition calculator, completely from first principles, out of logic gates.
                            I started small with a binary half adder, then scaled up to n-bit addition by chaining half adders together, which was easy enough.
                            The real challenge came with integrating denary into the interface. In particular, converting the binary outputs to denary was a 
                            tremendously difficult problem. I spent months theorizing and prototyping different solutions, before eventually finding an 
                            iterative steady-state based solution. I loved the process of continually developing my knowledge of the problem, and expanding my toolbox 
                            through each failed prototype. To indicate the scale this project, I've included a short video of my world.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Building Things That Matter</h2>
                <p class="story-text">
                    Throughout my career, I've focused on mastering the full spectrum of modern web development. I'm proficient in 
                    JavaScript and its ecosystem, including React and Node.js, which I've used to build responsive, performant applications. 
                    But beyond the technical stack, what excites me most is the problem-solving aspect—taking a complex challenge and 
                    breaking it down into elegant, maintainable solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">
                    One project I'm particularly proud of involved creating a task management application that helped users organize their 
                    daily workflows more efficiently. The challenge wasn't just building the features—it was understanding how people 
                    actually work and designing an interface that felt intuitive and natural. This required iterative testing, careful 
                    attention to user feedback, and a willingness to iterate until we got it right.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">
                    I've also developed automation tools that saved development teams hours of manual work each week. These projects 
                    taught me the value of looking beyond immediate requirements to find opportunities for systemic improvement—a mindset 
                    I believe aligns perfectly with Bending Spoons' approach to product development.
