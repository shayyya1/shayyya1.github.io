                    The goal of this document is to demonstrate my passion and technical achievements,
                    while explaining my motivation behind applying to a Software Engineering position at Bending Spoons. 
                    I hope you enjoy and appreciate my alignment with Bending Spoons' core values, such as sky-high standards and good judgement.

                        I think my first real dive into computational thinking started through playing Minecraft.
                        I had just learnt about logic gates in school, and in Minecraft there is redstone which functions the same way.
                        It quickly became a major project of mine to create an addition calculator, completely from first principles, out of logic gates.

                            I started small with a binary half adder, then scaled up to n-bit addition by chaining half adders together, which was easy enough.
                            The real challenge came with integrating denary into the interface. In particular, converting the binary outputs to denary was a 
                            tremendously difficult problem. I spent months theorising and prototyping different solutions, before eventually finding an 
                            iterative steady-state based solution. I loved the process of continually developing my knowledge of the problem, and expanding my toolbox 
                            through each failed prototype. To indicate the scale of this project, I've included a short video of my world.

                        My next major personal project was a program designed to solve the classic game Snake. 
                        I wrote this in Processing (a Java-based language), and it was my introduction to OOP.
                        I reframed the problem as finding a path from the snake's head to its tail, which goes through every cell in the grid.
                    </p>
                    <div class="technical-details" style="display: none;">

                            This is called a Hamiltonian path, and will guarantee success. I combined this idea with A* pathfinding, where the 
                            program would prioritise paths that led towards food. However, finding Hamiltonian paths is NP-Complete, so there is no
                            efficient solution. I instead created a recursive update procedure that can eliminate moves which are not on Hamiltonian paths,
                            but was not guaranteed to eliminate all invalid moves. This resulted in a high success rate, with the bot successfully beating the game 70% of the time.
                            In the video below you can see the update procedure in action. The black cells are the body of the snake, and the red is the head. 
                            All the other coloured states around the snake describe how many valid moves are available from that cell.
                            The key skills I learnt during this project which can be applied to Bending Spoons are independent research and creative thinking. 
                            I reduced the problem to one found in theory, and researched papers which gave insight and solutions. I then adopted and reapplied these solutions
                            within the context of my program, a process which is applicable throughout all facets of software engineering.

                        Beyond personal projects, I've had the opportunity to apply these problem-solving skills in professional environments.
                        This has allowed me to develop my communication and teamwork skills, as well as an emphasis on code quality and rigour.

                            During my time at South Park Primary School as an IT assistant, I realised the importance of adapting communication styles to your audience.
                            Teachers have very busy and stressful lives, so I needed to make my explanations as concise and understandable as possible, even if that meant excluding information.
                            This strategy vastly differedF from when I ran a maths challenge for students in Alexandra Park High School, where instead the focus was on engagement and entertainment.
                            I did this by creating a gamified environment, where learning and applying mathematics was a byproduct of playing the game, shifting students' perspectives from work to enjoyment.
                            I believe my ability to adapt communication styles and goals will be a key asset in integrating with and across teams at Bending Spoons.

                            Through my internship and graduate work at WTW, I have been able to develop my skills as a principled software engineer. 
                            Developing across a multi-location team of six during my internship, I was taught the value of clear architectural principles that prioritise 
                            readability and maintainability. Through the use of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture, I learnt how to segregate code by responsibility, 
                            and how these patterns encourage effective teamwork. During my graduate scheme, I have been a strong advocate for effective Agile practices. 
                            During a retrospective I raised the issue that our user-story acceptance criteria had become solution-focused, and explained how that could lead to requirement churn and 
                            lower code quality. This feedback was taken on by the team, and I was asked to join our team lead in creating acceptance criteria.

                <p class="story-text">
                    The main reason I want to join Bending Spoons is to realise my potential. 
                    Receiving the highest grade in my cohort of 200+ students at the University of Manchester has inspired me to take on as much challenge as possible.
                    I want to push my limits and see how far I can go. The Bending Spoons environment is the perfect place for me to find 
                    accelerated opportunities and continually learn at the greatest possible pace. 
                    The opportunity to grow in an environment surrounded by highly skilled engineers is invaluable to me.
