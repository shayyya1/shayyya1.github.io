                    When I first discovered Bending Spoons, I was immediately captivated by your mission to create products 
                    that genuinely improve people's lives through technology. Your portfolio—from productivity apps to creative 
                    tools—demonstrates a commitment to excellence that resonates deeply with my own values as a software developer.

                <p class="story-text">
                    I think my first real dive into computational thinking started through playing Minecraft.
                    I had just learned about logic gates in school, and in Minecraft there is redstone which functions the same way.
                    It quickly became a major project of mine to create an addition calculator, completely from first principles, out of logic gates.
                    I started small with a binary half adder, then scaled up to n-bit addition by chaining half adders together, which was easy enough.
                    The real challenge came with integrating denary into the interface. In particular, converting the binary outputs to denary was a 
                    tremendously difficult problem. I spent months theorizing and prototyping different solutions, before eventually finding an 
                    iterative steady-state based solution. I loved the process of continually developing my knowledge of the problem, and expanding my toolbox 
                    through each failed prototype. To indicate the scale this project, I've included a short video of my world.

                    My next major personal project was a programme designed to solve the classic game snake. 
                    I wrote this in Processing (a Java based language), and it was my introduction to OOP.
                    I reframed the problem as finding a path from the snakes head to its tail, which goes through every cell in the grid.
                    This is called a Hamiltonian path, and will guarantee success. I combined this idea with A* path finding, where the 
                    program would prioritise paths that led towards food. However, finding Hamiltonian paths is NP-Complete, so there is no
                    efficient solution. I instead creating a recursive update procedure that can eliminate moves which are not on Hamiltonian paths,
                    but is not guaranteed to elimante all invalid moves. This resulting in a high success rate, with the bot successfully beating the game 70% of the time.
                    In the video below you can see the update procedure in action. The black cells are the body of the snake, and the red is the head. 
                    All the other coloured states around the snake describe how many valid moves are available from that cell.
                    I think the key skills I learnt during this project which can be applied to bending spoons are independent research, and creative thinking. 
                    I reduced the problem to one found in theory, and researched papers which gave insight and solutions. I then adopted and reapplied these solutions
                    within the context of my program, a process which is applicable throughout all facets of software engineering.

                <p class="story-text">
                    Beyond personal projects, I've had the opportunity to apply these problem solving skills in professional environments.
                    This has allowed me to develop my communication and teamwork skills, as well as emphasis on code quality and rigour.
                    During my time at South Park Primary School as an IT assisstant, I realised the importance of adapting communication styles to your audience.
                    Teachers have very busy and stressful lives, so I needed to make my explanations as concise and understandable as possible, even if that means excluding information.
                    This strategy vastly differs from when I ran a maths challenge for students in Alexandra Park High School, where instead the focus was on engagement and entertainment.
                    I did this by creating a gamified environment, where learning and applying mathematics was a byproduct of playing the game, shifting students perspectives from work to enjoyment.
                    I believe my ability to adapt communication styles and goals will be a key asset in integrating with, and across, teams at Bending Spoons.

                    Through my Internship and Graduate work at WTW, I have been able to develop my skills as a principled software engineer. 
                    Developing across a multi-location team of 6 during my internship I was taught the value of clear architectural principles that prioritise 
                    readability and maintainability. Through the use of Domain-Driven-Design and Clean Architecture I learnt how to segregate code by responsibilities, 
                    and how these patterns encourage effective teamwork. During my Graduate scheme, I have been a strong advocate for effective Agile practices, learnt at University. 
                    During a retrospective I raised the issue that our user story acceptance criteria had become solution focused, and explained how that can lead to requirement churn and 
                    lower code quality. This feedback was taken on by the team, and I was asked to join our team lead in creating acceptance criteria.
