                        My first real dive into computational thinking started through playing Minecraft.
                        I had recently learnt about logic gates in school, and in Minecraft there is redstone which functions the same way.
                        It quickly became a major project of mine to create an addition calculator, completely from first principles, out of logic gates.
                        I spent months theorising and prototyping different solutions. I loved the process of continually developing my knowledge of the problem, and expanding my toolbox 
                        through each failed prototype. To illustrate the scale of this project, I've included a short video of my world.

                            I started small with a binary half adder, then scaled up to n-bit addition by chaining half adders together, which was easy enough.
                            The real challenge came with integrating denary into the interface. In particular, converting the binary outputs to denary was a 
                            tremendously difficult problem. I eventually created a steady-state based iterative solution that converts binary to BCD.
                            It does this by separating each binary digit into denary components, and summing these across all digits. 
                            For example, 11000000 breaks down into 128 + 64, which we then further break down into one 100, two 10s and six 10s, an eight and a four.
                            We sum across each denary place value to get one 100, eight 10s, and twelve. 
                            We then feed this output back into the system, so the twelve becomes one 10 and two, and so on. Eventually a steady-state is reached and the BCD representation is obtained.

                        My next major personal project was a program designed to solve the classic game Snake. 
                        I wrote this in Processing (a Java-based language), and it was my introduction to OOP.
                        I reframed the problem as finding a path from the snake's head to its tail, which goes through every cell in the grid.
                        After extensive research and problem-solving, I created a recursive update procedure which I combined with A* pathfinding.
                        This resulted in a 70% success rate, far exceeding my manual attempts.
                        The key skills I gained during this project which can be applied to Bending Spoons are independent research and creative thinking. 
                        I reduced the problem to one found in theory, and researched papers which gave insight and solutions. I then adopted and reapplied these solutions
                        within the context of my program, a process which is applicable throughout all facets of software engineering.

                            The process of finding a path which goes through all cells exactly once is called a Hamiltonian path, and these are guaranteed to solve Snake as you cannot double back on yourself.
                            I combined a decision procedure for finding Hamiltonian paths with A* pathfinding, where the 
                            program would prioritise paths that led towards food. However, finding Hamiltonian paths is NP-Complete, so there is no
                            efficient solution. I instead created a recursive update procedure that can eliminate moves which are not on Hamiltonian paths,
                            but was not guaranteed to eliminate all invalid moves. 
                            In the video below you can see the update procedure in action. The black cells are the body of the snake, and the red is the head. 
                            All the other coloured states around the snake describe how many valid moves are available from that cell.

                        Beyond personal projects, I've had the opportunity to apply these problem-solving skills in professional environments.
                        This has allowed me to develop my communication and teamwork skills, as well as an emphasis on code quality and rigour.

                            During my time at South Park Primary School as an IT assistant, I realised the importance of adapting communication styles to your audience.
                            Given the demanding lives of teachers, I ensured my explanations were concise and understandable, even if that meant excluding information.
                            This strategy vastly differed from when I ran a maths challenge for students in Alexandra Park High School, where instead the focus was on engagement and entertainment.
                            I did this by creating a gamified environment, where learning and applying mathematics was a byproduct of playing the game, shifting students' perspectives from work to enjoyment.
                            I believe my ability to adapt communication styles and goals will be a key asset in integrating with and across teams at Bending Spoons.

                            My internship and graduate work at WTW provided me the opportunity to develop my skills as a principled software engineer. 
                            Developing across a multi-location team of six during my internship, I was taught the value of clear architectural principles that prioritise 
                            readability and maintainability. Through the use of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture, I learnt how to segregate code by responsibility, 
                            and how these patterns encourage effective teamwork. During my graduate scheme, I have been a strong advocate for effective Agile practices. 
                            During a retrospective, I highlighted that our user-story acceptance criteria had become solution-focused. I explained how this could lead to requirement churn and 
                            lower code quality. This feedback was taken on by the team, and I was asked to join our team lead in creating acceptance criteria.
