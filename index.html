                <h2 class="section-heading">My Journey into Software Development</h2>
                <p class="story-text">
                    My path to software engineering began with a simple fascination: how can we use code to solve real problems? 
                    Over the past several years, I've transformed that curiosity into a career focused on building elegant, 
                    user-centric applications. From my early days learning the fundamentals to now architecting complex systems, 
                    each project has reinforced my belief that great software is about understanding people, not just technology.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">
                    I've had the privilege of working on diverse teams where I contributed to products used by thousands of users daily. 
                    These experiences taught me that the best solutions emerge when you combine technical excellence with genuine empathy 
                    for the end user—a philosophy I see reflected in every Bending Spoons product.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Building Things That Matter</h2>
                <p class="story-text">
                    Throughout my career, I've focused on mastering the full spectrum of modern web development. I'm proficient in 
                    JavaScript and its ecosystem, including React and Node.js, which I've used to build responsive, performant applications. 
                    But beyond the technical stack, what excites me most is the problem-solving aspect—taking a complex challenge and 
                    breaking it down into elegant, maintainable solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">
                    One project I'm particularly proud of involved creating a task management application that helped users organize their 
                    daily workflows more efficiently. The challenge wasn't just building the features—it was understanding how people 
                    actually work and designing an interface that felt intuitive and natural. This required iterative testing, careful 
                    attention to user feedback, and a willingness to iterate until we got it right.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">
                    I've also developed automation tools that saved development teams hours of manual work each week. These projects 
                    taught me the value of looking beyond immediate requirements to find opportunities for systemic improvement—a mindset 
                    I believe aligns perfectly with Bending Spoons' approach to product development.
